In JavaScript, loops are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. They are essential for handling repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures. 
1)For Loop:

Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be repeated
}

EXAMPLE:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}


2)While Loop:

Syntax:
javascript
Copy code
while (condition) {
    // Code to be repeated
}


Example:
javascript
Copy code
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
