Conditional statements in programming are constructs that allow the execution of different code blocks based on certain conditions. These statements enable a program to make decisions and choose different paths of execution depending on whether a given condition is true or false. 
In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed



Syntax
if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
